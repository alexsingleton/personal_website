In this article, we explore methodological approaches for deriving indicators that estimate the willingness to pay for retail and leisure services offered by retail centers. Most often, because the quality of urban environments cannot be qualified by a natural unit, the willingness to pay for an urban environment is explored through the lens of the residential housing market. Traditional approaches control for individual characteristics of houses, meaning that the remaining variation in the price can be unpacked and related to the availability of local amenities or, equivalently, the willingness to pay. In this article, we use similar motivations but exchange housing prices for residential properties with property taxes paid by nondomestic properties to glean hierarchies of retail centers. We outline the applied methodological steps that include very recent, nontrivial contributions from the literature to estimate these hierarchies and provide clear instructions for reproducing the methodology. Using the case study of England and Wales, we undertake a series of econometric experiments to rigorously assess retail center willingness to pay (RWTP) as a test of the methods reviewed. We build intuition toward our preferred specification, a Bayesian multilevel model, that accounts for the possibility of a spatial autoregressive process. Overall, the applied methodology describes a blueprint for building hierarchies of retail spaces and addresses the limited availability of spatial data that measure the economic and social value of retail centers.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Building Hierarchies of Retail Centers Using Bayesian Multilevel Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Singleton","Paul Longley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"fe4c5cde3a717f635f0f5c30846e6e62","permalink":"/publication/48/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/48/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years a mix of Open Data and commercial sources have been used to build geodemographic classifications of neighbourhoods.

Using the network analysis process of Routino, postcode accessibility (km) to each of these features were calculated for the whole of Great Britain. An average score for each domain was calculated and subsequently combined to form an overall Index highlighting ‘Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards’.

However, such representations are influenced by the methodological choices made during their construction. Of particular debate are the choice and specification of input variables, with the objective of identifying inputs that add value but also aim for model parsimony. Within this context, our paper introduces a principal component analysis (PCA)-based automated variable selection methodology that has the objective of identifying candidate inputs to a geodemographic classification from a collection of variables. The proposed methodology is exemplified in the context of variables from the UK 2011 Census, and its output compared to the Office for National Statistics 2011 Output Area Classification (2011 OAC). Through the implementation of the proposed methodology, the quality of the cluster assignment was improved relative to 2011 OAC, manifested by a lower total within-cluster sum of square score. Across the UK, more than 70.2% of the Output Areas (OAs) occupied by the newly created classification (i.e. AVS-OAC) outperform the 2011 OAC, with particularly strong performance within Scotland and Wales.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based framework for automated variable selection in geodemographic classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Les Dolega","Jonathan Reynolds","Alex Singleton","Michalis Pavlis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554422400,"objectID":"b3151153ae307514bdddca062943b091","permalink":"/publication/50/","publishdate":"2019-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/50/","section":"publication","summary":"Early attempts to classify shopping activity often took a relatively simple approach, largely driven by the lack of reliable data beyond fascia name and retail outlet counts by centre. There seems to be a consensus amongst contemporary scholars, commercial research consultancies and retailers that more comprehensive classifications would generate better-informed debate on changes in the urban economic landscape, as well as providing the basis for a more effective comparison of retail centres across time and space, particularly given the availability of new data sources and techniques and in the context of the transformational changes presently affecting the retail sector. This paper seeks to demonstrate the interrelationship between supply and demand for retailing services by integrating newly available data sources within a rigorously specified classification methodology. This in turn provides new insight into the multidimensional and dynamic taxonomy of consumption spaces within Great Britain. First, such a contribution is significant in that it moves debate within the literature past simple linear scaling of retail centre function to a more nuanced understanding of multiple functional forms; and second, in that it provides a nationally comparative and dynamic framework through which the evolution of retail structures can be evaluated. Using non-hierarchical clustering techniques, the results are presented in the form of a two-tier classification with 5 distinctive ‘coarse’ clusters and 15 more detailed and nested sub-clusters. The paper concludes that more nuanced and dynamic classifications of this kind can help deliver more effective insights into changing role of retailing and consumer services in urban areas across space and through time and will have implications for a variety of stakeholders.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Beyond retail: New ways of classifying UK shopping and consumption spaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Singleton","Dani Arribas-Bel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554336000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554336000,"objectID":"48bc6c228b56a4495a78f866b28e697f","permalink":"/publication/49/","publishdate":"2019-04-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/49/","section":"publication","summary":"It is widely acknowledged that the emergence of “Big Data” is having a profound and often controversial impact on the production of knowledge.

This paper focuses on urban areas of interest (UAOI), a concept that provides functional definitions of a city’s spatial structure. Traditional sources of social data can rarely capture these aspects at scale while spatial information on the city alone does not capture how the population values different parts of the city and in different ways. Hence, we leverage volunteered geographic information (VGI) to overcome some of the limits of traditional sources in providing urban structural and functional insights. We use a special type of VGI—metadata from geotagged Flickr images—to identify UAOIs and exploit their temporal and spatial attributes. To do this, we propose a methodological strategy that combines hierarchical density-based spatial clustering for applications with noise and the ‘α-shape’ algorithm to quantify the dynamics of UAOIs in Inner London for a period 2013–2015 and develop an innovative visualisation of UAOI profiles from which UAOI dynamics can be explored. Our results expand and improve upon the previous literature on this topic and provide a useful reference for urban practitioners who might wish to include more timely information when making decisions.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Understanding the dynamics of urban areas of interest through volunteered geographic information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Singleton"],"categories":[],"content":" from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')  print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!

Self-medication is where one ‘self’ diagnoses and prescribes over the counter medicines for treatment. The self-care movement has important policy implications, perceived to relieve the National Health Service (NHS) burden, increasing patient subsistence and freeing resources for more serious ailments. However, there has been little research exploring how self-medication behaviours vary between population groups due to a lack of available data. The aim of our study is to evaluate how high street retailer loyalty card data can help inform our understanding of how individuals self-medicate in England. Transaction level loyalty card data was acquired from a national high street retailer for England for 2012–2014. We calculated the proportion of loyalty card customers (n ~ 10 million) within Lower Super Output Areas who purchased the following medicines- ‘coughs and colds’, ‘Hayfever’, ‘pain relief’ and ‘sun preps’. Machine learning was used to explore how 50 sociodemographic and health accessibility features were associated towards explaining purchasing of each product group. Random Forests are used as a baseline and Gradient Boosting as our final model. Our results showed that pain relief was the most common medicine purchased. There was little difference in purchasing behaviours by sex other than for sun preps. The gradient boosting models demonstrated that socioeconomic status of areas, as well as air pollution, were important predictors of each medicine. Our study adds to the self-medication literature through demonstrating the usefulness of loyalty card records for producing insights about how self-medication varies at the national level. Big data offer novel insights that add to and address issues that traditional studies are unable to consider. New forms of data through data linkage may offer opportunities to improve current public health decision making surrounding at risk population groups within self-medication behaviours.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Using machine learning to investigate self-medication purchasing in England via high street retailer loyalty card data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tamara Thiele","Daniel Pope","Alex Singleton","Debbie Stanistreet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541289600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541289600,"objectID":"837c6541020ce4241c58d7ad32ff85de","permalink":"/publication/47/","publishdate":"2018-11-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/47/","section":"publication","summary":"Globally, the need for evidence to guide widening participation (WP) practices aimed at reducing inequalities in higher education (HE) participation is recognised more than ever before.

This paper provides such guidance, describing the challenges and benefits of combining qualitative and quantitative methods within a single research design and discusses these issues in relation to epistemological approach, study design frameworks, methods of data collection, analytical approaches and issues of validity and reliability.

The variability of retail unit density can be related to both the type and function of retail centers, but also to characteristics such as size and extent of urban areas, population distribution, or property values. The suggested method implements a sparse graph representation of the retail unit locations based on a distance‐constrained k‐nearest neighbor adjacency list that is subsequently decomposed using the Depth First Search algorithm. DBSCAN is iteratively applied to each subgraph to extract the clusters with point density closer to an overall density for each study area. This innovative approach has the advantage of adjusting the radius parameter of DBSCAN at the local scale, thus improving the clustering output. A comparison of the estimated retail clusters against a sample of existing boundaries of retail areas shows that the suggested methodology provides a simple yet accurate and flexible way to automate the process of identifying retail clusters of varying shapes and densities across large areas; and by extension, enables their automated update over time.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A Modified DBSCAN Clustering Method to Estimate Retail Center Extent","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tamara Thiele","Daniel Pope","Alex Singleton","Darlene Snape","Debbie Stanistreet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1481500800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481500800,"objectID":"e96c44ae59c2c3f6fa71af0c52299426","permalink":"/publication/34/","publishdate":"2016-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/34/","section":"publication","summary":"Pervasive socio‐economic differences in relation to participation in higher education in the United Kingdom are particularly prominent in the most prestigious institutions. This study provides insight into why some individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds are successful in being admitted into one of these institutions. Underpinned by phenomenology, semi‐structured interviews were carried out to examine the lived experiences of high‐achieving students from socio‐economically disadvantaged backgrounds throughout their educational trajectories from primary school to a Russell Group university. Two main themes emerged from the data- identity and educational engagement. Various sources of disadvantage associated with material hardship, socio‐cultural and interpersonal factors were strongly linked to identity and students’ perceptions of their own social status. In turn, these factors and identity‐related constructs associated with peer‐group memberships, low expectations and negative group stereotypes affected how individuals engaged with education, contributing, for instance, to their lack of active involvement at school/college and poor attendance. However, identity‐related factors were also found to influence individuals’ educational engagement positively, including their motivations for overcoming obstacles, achieving high grades and pursuing HE.

This research explores the generation of neighbourhood characteristics and other attributes using a geographic data science approach, taking advantage of the increasing availability of such spatial data from open data sources. We adopt a SOM (Self-Organizing Maps) methodology to create a classification of Multidimensional Open Data Urban Morphology (MODUM) and test the extent to which this output systematically follows conventional socioeconomic profiles. Such an analysis can also provide a simplified structure of the physical properties of geographic space that can be further used as input to more complex socioeconomic models.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A Classification of Multidimensional Open Data for Urban Morphology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris Gale","Alex Singleton","Andrew Bates","Paul Longley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"8b09e652633d6eb66b2dc6705fe18720","permalink":"/publication/39/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/39/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents the methodology that has been used to create the 2011 Area Classification for Output Areas (2011 OAC).

We present an innovative methodology that classifies both 2001 and 2011 census data inputs utilising a unified geography and set of attributes to create a classification that spans both census periods. Through this classification, we examine the temporal stability of the clusters and whether other secondary data sources and internal measures might usefully indicate local uncertainties in such a classification during an intercensal period.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The stability of geodemographic cluster assignments over an intercensal period","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tamara Thiele","Daniel Pope","Alex Singleton","Debbie Stanistreet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1457654400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1457654400,"objectID":"6c28c6866fb41e931313d4c63156b030","permalink":"/publication/33/","publishdate":"2016-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/33/","section":"publication","summary":"Objectives - This study examines associations between medical students’ background characteristics (postcode-based measures of disadvantage, high school attended, sociodemographic characteristics), and academic achievement at a Russell Group University; Design - Retrospective cohort analysis; Setting - Applicants accepted at the University of Liverpool medical school between 2004 and 2006, finalising their studies between 2010 and 2011; Participants - 571 students (with an English home postcode) registered on the full-time Medicine and Surgery programme, who successfully completed their medical degree; Main outcome measures - Final average at year 4 of the medical programme (represented as a percentage); Results - Entry grades were positively associated with final attainment (p","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Role of students’ context in predicting academic performance at a medical school: a retrospective cohort study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Singleton","Seth Spielman","Chris Brunsdon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1454630400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1454630400,"objectID":"ce5171eeac3a69208db0028dec2d3acc","permalink":"/publication/35/","publishdate":"2016-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/35/","section":"publication","summary":"When conducting research within a framework of Geographic Information Science (GISc), the scientific validity of this work can be argued as highly dependent upon the extent to which the methods employed are reproducible, and that, in the strictest sense, can only be fully achieved by implementing transparent workflows that utilize both open source software and openly available data.

These small area estimates suffer from large margins of error, however, which makes the data difficult to use for many purposes. The value of a large and comprehensive survey like the ACS is that it provides a richly detailed, multivariate, composite picture of small areas. This article argues that one solution to the problem of large margins of error in the ACS is to shift from a variable-based mode of inquiry to one that emphasizes a composite multivariate picture of census tracts. Because the margin of error in a single ACS estimate, like household income, is assumed to be a symmetrically distributed random variable, positive and negative errors are equally likely. Because the variable-specific estimates are largely independent from each other, when looking at a large collection of variables these random errors average to zero. This means that although single variables can be methodologically problematic at the census tract scale, a large collection of such variables provides utility as a contextual descriptor of the place(s) under investigation. This idea is demonstrated by developing a geodemographic typology of all U.S. census tracts. The typology is firmly rooted in the social scientific literature and is organized around a framework of concepts, domains, and measures. The typology is validated using public domain data from the City of Chicago and the U.S. Federal Election Commission. The typology, as well as the data and methods used to create it, is open source and published freely online.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Studying Neighborhoods Using Uncertain Data from the American Community Survey: A Contextual Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Singleton","Paul Longley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1439424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1439424000,"objectID":"bbc2eb749c474e7fa8484bbefac3fd51","permalink":"/publication/31/","publishdate":"2015-08-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/31/","section":"publication","summary":"Geodemographic classifications are categorical measures representing salient multidimensional population and built environment attributes of small areas.

In it we identify the types of quantitative methods taught in the geography curricula for UK schools and universities, and discuss attitudes towards those methods amongst students and teachers. We argue that geography has benefitted from its position at the intersection of the sciences, social sciences and humanities, retaining a quantitative component. Consequently, levels of basic numeracy and data handling have remained relatively high, leaving the discipline well placed to respond to the call for greater quantitative training within the social sciences in the UK. However, we also suspect that the typical levels of quantitative training in university human geography courses are not sufficiently high to compete on the international stage. As the title suggests, our report is focused on geography. However we raise issues germane to other disciplines including what actually we mean by quantitative methods, what should be taught in a twenty-first century curriculum, how to meaningfully embed those methods in the substantive themes and teaching of a discipline, and whether more should be expected as a minimum standard of quantitative competence than the existing Quality Assurance Agency benchmarks require.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Geographers Count: A Report on Quantitative Methods in Geography","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nick Bearman","Alex Singleton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1417392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417392000,"objectID":"4c25b2c89310aa30cf192cbda8192b6f","permalink":"/publication/29/","publishdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/29/","section":"publication","summary":"Active travel for the home to school commute is an ideal opportunity to improve pupil׳s physical activity levels.

The changes are quantified in terms of the proportion using active travel, CO2 emissions and criterion distances- a method of measuring how far pupils are willing to travel using a certain mode of transport. Findings suggest that the greatest reduction in CO2 and increase in health benefits can be made by encouraging more primary school pupils to use active travel and targeting schools with existing low levels of active travel.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Modelling the potential impact on CO2 emissions of an increased uptake of active travel for the home to school commute using individual level data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thiele, Tamara","Alex Singleton","Daniel Pope","Debbi Stanistreet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1417046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417046400,"objectID":"67b33ac485c4102aebd12bb1067e4cc5","permalink":"/publication/25/","publishdate":"2014-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/25/","section":"publication","summary":"Students' trajectories into university are often uniquely dependent on school qualifications though these alone are limited as predictors of academic potential. This study endorses this, examining associations between school grades, school type, school performance, socio-economic deprivation, neighbourhood participation, sex and academic achievement at a British university. Consistent with past research, large entry-level differences between students are generally narrowed by final year at university. Students from the most deprived areas performed less well than more affluent students. Asian and black students performed less well than white students. Female students performed better than their male counterparts. Contrasting with past research, though school performance was positively associated with entry grades, students from low-performing schools were more likely to achieve the highest degree classifications.

In a UK context, the pupil-school commute is estimated to contribute around 658 kilotonnes of CO2 per year; however, tackling this issue effectively requires an improved understanding of how emissions can be modelled and mapped over a variety of scales. This paper implements a new estimation technique for the modelling of CO2 emissions linked with the school commute that integrates both transport network-level routing and geographically disaggregate vehicle emissions data. The model is then applied to a national cohort of pupils in England. Areas demonstrating the highest emissions were typically more rural and/or comprising more affluent resident populations. Emissions were also shown to increase with school year, with larger step changes between educational stages reflecting the different geography of school locations.

The heterogeneous geography of broadband infrastructure and investments results in variable service provision, and as such, there exist large disparities in access and performance within different spatio-temporal locations. This paper presents analysis of 4.7 million crowdsourced Internet speed test results that were compiled between 2010 and 2013 alongside various indicators of socio-spatial structure to map disparities in English broadband speed between and within urban areas. Although average speeds have improved over time, inequity is shown to emerge between different societal groups and locations. Short-term dynamics also reveal that in areas of different density, speeds can fall dramatically during peak hours, thus influencing the availability of services. The apparent disparities in access and performance represent a major issue as Internet use becomes increasingly ubiquitous in our everyday lives, with inequalities evoking social and economic disadvantage at local and national scales. This work resonates with UK government policy that has stimulated considerable investment in improving infrastructure, and presents analysis of an expansive crowd sourced “big data” resource for the first time.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Broadband speed equity: A new digital divide?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Singleton","Chris Brunsdon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1404864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1404864000,"objectID":"43cd9ddbc9253a5a28d9b20c8d4e0821","permalink":"/publication/26/","publishdate":"2014-07-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/26/","section":"publication","summary":"In 2011 the Home Office released the police.uk website, which provided a high‐resolution map of recent crime data for the national extents of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

However, as part of this open selection, the demand from parents opting to send their children to the best performing schools far outstrips the supply of available places at them, and consequently many schools ration places using entry criteria that favour those pupils domiciled close to the school. Through this geographic selection process, choice is spatially sorted and access to the best schools is often crucially dependent upon where parents live. After illustrating this problem, this paper develops an automated modelling technique that can be used to define and map school catchment areas based on the home locations of pupils attending every publically funded school in England. It then develops this framework to create a web based decision support tool to aid parents seeking secondary school places.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Estimating Secondary School Catchment Areas and the Spatial Equity of Access","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Singleton","Daniel Lewis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1320537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1320537600,"objectID":"1a4aa3e4c45f2f0bdfc2d32bd6626401","permalink":"/publication/15/","publishdate":"2011-11-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/15/","section":"publication","summary":"Between 2005 and 2007 there were 9071 traffic accidents involving bicycles within London and this paper demonstrates the utility of Geographic Information Systems as a tool for analysing and visualising these occurrences.

We argue that, while general-purpose ethnicity classifications offer a method of standardising results, such groupings are inherently unstable, both in their upward aggregation and in their downward granulation. As such, the results of ethnicity analysis may possess no validity independent of the ethnicity classes upon which it is based. While this conclusion is intuitive, it nevertheless seems to pass unnoticed in the interpretation of research conducted in public policy applications such as education, health and residential segregation. In this paper we use examples based on the standard Census classification of ethnicity, alongside new rich ethnicity datasets from the education domain, in order to evaluate the sensitivity of results to the particular aggregation that is chosen.

In response to the critique of geodemographics as a ‘black box’ technology, we describe how the classification was opened up to public scrutiny and how we conducted a major consultation exercise into the reliability of its results. We assess the message of the 50,000+ searches and 3952 responses collected during the consultation exercise, in terms of possible systematic errors in the shape and detail of the classification. Unusually for Internet-based surveys, we also investigate the likely reliability of the response information received and identify ways in which the outcome of consultation might be used to improve the classification. We believe that this is the first-ever large-scale consultation survey of the validity and remit of a geodemographic classification and that it may have wider implications for the creation of geodemographic classifications.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Classification through consultation: public views of the geography of the e-Society","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Singleton","Paul Longley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1249430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1249430400,"objectID":"8b4dbaef88dd2e19cc11689be16ba2d5","permalink":"/publication/4/","publishdate":"2009-08-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/4/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper explores the use of geodemographic classifications to investigate the social, economic and spatial dimensions of participation in Higher Education (HE).

However, some neighbourhoods are `digitally unengaged' but not materially deprived and the paper investigates the extent to which this outcome may be linked to factors such as lack of confidence, skills or motivation. As with material deprivation, there are distinctive regional and local geographies of digital unengagement and these have important implications for digital policy implementation.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Linking Social Deprivation and Digital Exclusion in England","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Muki Haklay","Alex Singleton","Chris Parker"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1227052800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1227052800,"objectID":"e35ee5d6a2d0b25ff2db4054cbb402aa","permalink":"/publication/1/","publishdate":"2008-11-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/1/","section":"publication","summary":"The landscape of Internet mapping technologies has changed dramatically since 2005. New techniques are being used and new terms have been invented and entered the lexicon such as mash‐ups, crowdsourcing, neogeography and geostack. A whole range of websites and communities from the commercial Google Maps to the grassroots OpenStreetMap, and applications such as Platial, also have emerged. In their totality, these new applications represent a step change in the evolution of the area of Internet geographic applications (which some have termed the GeoWeb). The nature of this change warrants an explanation and an overview, as it has implications both for geographers and the public notion of Geography. This article provides a critical review of this newly emerging landscape, starting with an introduction to the concepts, technologies and structures that have emerged over the short period of intense innovation. It introduces the non‐technical reader to them, suggests reasons for the neologism, explains the terminology, and provides a perspective on the current trends. Case studies are used to demonstrate this Web Mapping 2.0 era, and differentiate it from the previous generation of Internet mapping. Finally, the implications of these new techniques and the challenges they pose to geographic information science, geography and society at large are considered..","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Web Mapping 2.0: The Neogeography of the GeoWeb","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maurizio Gibin","Alex Singleton","Richard Milton","Pablo Mateos","Paul Longley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1208995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1208995200,"objectID":"8eb2070c9756a7c670072b1a7052cdc3","permalink":"/publication/2/","publishdate":"2008-04-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper begins by reviewing the ways in which the innovation of Google Maps has transformed our ability to reference and view geographically referenced data. We describe the ways in which the GMap Creator tool developed under the ESRC National Centre for e Social Science (NCeSS) programme enables users to ‘mashup’ thematic choropleth maps using the Google API. We illustrate the application of GMap Creator using the example of www.londonprofiler.org, which presents a repository of choropleth maps across a range of domains including health, education and other socioeconomic datasets against a backcloth of Google Maps data. Our conclusions address the ways in which Google Map mashups developed using GMap Creator facilitate online exploratory cartographic visualisation in a range of areas of policy concern.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"An Exploratory Cartographic Visualisation of London through the Google Maps API","type":"publication"}]
