Where applications to HE are administered through centralised admission services, applicants will often make multiple initial course choices, which offers an opportunity to examine systematic groupings of interest within course choice sets, and assess whether certain types of student are more likely to make concentrated or diffuse subject selections. Utilising a national database of an entire cohort's application behaviour, the empirical findings presented in this article indicate that there are clusters of subjects that are applied for in combination, and that certain ethnic minority, socio-economic groups and neighbourhood types are more likely to make more diffuse subject choices. This creates an information base of generalised course choice behaviours that HE institutions could utilise for targeted marketing, recruitment and selection activities, and additionally forms the basis of a decision support framework that could be implemented in a variety of online tools to help guide student courses.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Data Mining Course Choice Sets and Behaviours for Target Marketing of Higher Education","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Mateos","Alex Singleton","Paul Longley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1251072000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1251072000,"objectID":"b3097097d85848fb32f500f754dba046","permalink":"/publication/6/","publishdate":"2009-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/6/","section":"publication","summary":"Uncertainty is inherent in the conception and measurement of ethnicity, by both individuals themselves and those who seek to gather evidence of discrimination or inequalities in social and economic outcomes. These issues have received attention in the literature, yet rather little research has been carried out on the uncertainty subsequently created through the analysis of such measurements. We argue that, while general-purpose ethnicity classifications offer a method of standardising results, such groupings are inherently unstable, both in their upward aggregation and in their downward granulation. As such, the results of ethnicity analysis may possess no validity independent of the ethnicity classes upon which it is based. While this conclusion is intuitive, it nevertheless seems to pass unnoticed in the interpretation of research conducted in public policy applications such as education, health and residential segregation. In this paper we use examples based on the standard Census classification of ethnicity, alongside new rich ethnicity datasets from the education domain, in order to evaluate the sensitivity of results to the particular aggregation that is chosen. We use a case study to empirically illustrate the far-reaching consequences of this commonly overlooked source of uncertainty.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Uncertainty in the Analysis of Ethnicity Classifications: Issues of Extent and Aggregation of Ethnic Groups","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Singleton","Paul Longley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1249430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1249430400,"objectID":"8b4dbaef88dd2e19cc11689be16ba2d5","permalink":"/publication/4/","publishdate":"2009-08-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/4/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper explores the use of geodemographic classifications to investigate the social, economic and spatial dimensions of participation in Higher Education (HE).

This is achieved by matching the 2004 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) with a unique nation-wide geodemographic classification of ICT usage, aggregated to unit postcodes. The results of the cross-classification suggest that lack of digital engagement and material deprivation are linked, with high levels of material deprivation generally associated with low levels of engagement with ICTs and vice versa. However, some neighbourhoods are `digitally unengaged' but not materially deprived and the paper investigates the extent to which this outcome may be linked to factors such as lack of confidence, skills or motivation. As with material deprivation, there are distinctive regional and local geographies of digital unengagement and these have important implications for digital policy implementation.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Linking Social Deprivation and Digital Exclusion in England","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Muki Haklay","Alex Singleton","Chris Parker"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1227052800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1227052800,"objectID":"e35ee5d6a2d0b25ff2db4054cbb402aa","permalink":"/publication/1/","publishdate":"2008-11-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/1/","section":"publication","summary":"The landscape of Internet mapping technologies has changed dramatically since 2005. New techniques are being used and new terms have been invented and entered the lexicon such as mash‐ups, crowdsourcing, neogeography and geostack. A whole range of websites and communities from the commercial Google Maps to the grassroots OpenStreetMap, and applications such as Platial, also have emerged. In their totality, these new applications represent a step change in the evolution of the area of Internet geographic applications (which some have termed the GeoWeb). The nature of this change warrants an explanation and an overview, as it has implications both for geographers and the public notion of Geography. This article provides a critical review of this newly emerging landscape, starting with an introduction to the concepts, technologies and structures that have emerged over the short period of intense innovation. It introduces the non‐technical reader to them, suggests reasons for the neologism, explains the terminology, and provides a perspective on the current trends. Case studies are used to demonstrate this Web Mapping 2.0 era, and differentiate it from the previous generation of Internet mapping. Finally, the implications of these new techniques and the challenges they pose to geographic information science, geography and society at large are considered..","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Web Mapping 2.0: The Neogeography of the GeoWeb","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maurizio Gibin","Alex Singleton","Richard Milton","Pablo Mateos","Paul Longley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1208995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1208995200,"objectID":"8eb2070c9756a7c670072b1a7052cdc3","permalink":"/publication/2/","publishdate":"2008-04-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper begins by reviewing the ways in which the innovation of Google Maps has transformed our ability to reference and view geographically referenced data. We describe the ways in which the GMap Creator tool developed under the ESRC National Centre for e Social Science (NCeSS) programme enables users to ‘mashup’ thematic choropleth maps using the Google API. We illustrate the application of GMap Creator using the example of www.londonprofiler.org, which presents a repository of choropleth maps across a range of domains including health, education and other socioeconomic datasets against a backcloth of Google Maps data. Our conclusions address the ways in which Google Map mashups developed using GMap Creator facilitate online exploratory cartographic visualisation in a range of areas of policy concern.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"An Exploratory Cartographic Visualisation of London through the Google Maps API","type":"publication"}]
